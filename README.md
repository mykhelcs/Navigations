# Navigations
Owner: Glenn Mykhel V. Gulfan

A modern Flutter mobile application demonstrating multi-screen architecture and seamless tab transitions using Flutter's `BottomNavigationBar` and `IndexedStack`. Built with Material 3 styling and clean separation of concerns, the app provides a smooth, state-preserving user experience across authentication, dashboards, profile management, and settings.

## Features

- **Authentication Flow**: Secure-style mock sign-in with prefilled credentials and route guards.
- **State-Preserving Tab Navigation**: Multi-screen shell using `IndexedStack` to preserve widget scroll and input state across tab switches.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Metric summary counters (Projects, Tasks, Messages) and recent activity items.
- **User Profile Management**: Profile card with avatar, role information, contact metadata, and a one-tap logout action.
- **Reactive Settings**: Interactive preference controls with immediate UI state feedback (Dark Mode toggle, Notification alerts).
- **Test-Driven Reliability**: Comprehensive automated widget test suite validating full end-to-end navigation flows.

## Screen Descriptions

### 1. Login Screen (`lib/screens/login_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Serves as the authentication gateway for the app.
- **Components**: Branded lock icon header, email and password text fields with validation keys, and a prominent "Login" action button.
- **Flow**: Tapping "Login" replaces the current route with the main application shell (`/main`).

### 2. Main Navigation Shell (`lib/screens/main_navigation_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Acts as the root container for authenticated tabs.
- **Components**: A persistent `BottomNavigationBar` fixed with three destinations: **Dashboard**, **Profile**, and **Setting**.
- **Flow**: Wraps pages in an `IndexedStack` to prevent rebuilding tabs on switch, maintaining scroll positions and widget states.

### 3. Dashboard Screen (`lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: High-level overview and landing tab upon authentication.
- **Components**:
  - Welcome greeting card ("Hello, Alex Mercer 👋").
  - Three-column metrics row displaying active Projects, Tasks, and Messages.
  - Recent activity card tracking completed and in-progress tasks.

### 4. Profile Screen (`lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Displays user identity and account management options.
- **Components**:
  - User avatar, full name, professional title, and bio description.
  - Contact information card with email and phone tiles.
  - Highlighted **Log Out** button which clears the navigation stack and redirects back to the Login screen.

### 5. Settings Screen (`lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Application preferences and general configurations.
- **Components**:
  - Interactive switches for **Dark Mode** and **Notifications**.
  - Informational tiles for application Language and Version (`1.0.0 (Mock)`).
